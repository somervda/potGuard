## potGuard: A telephone line, spam guard

This project will manage calls coming in on my landline (pot - plain old telephone) telephone. I want to be able to turn the whole line on and off remotely (An aggressive do not disturb) as well as having rules defined for when it will pass calls through to my land line. This will be based on a "well known caller" list. I also need to be able to pick up a receiver and make a call.

This project will use; a caller ID board, a latched relay, a Raspberry Pi Pico wireless board and micropython.
